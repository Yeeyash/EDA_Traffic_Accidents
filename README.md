# 🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis: Traffic Accidents

This is my first project in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I analyze real-world traffic accident data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can potentially inform better road safety and urban planning decisions.

---

## 📊 Objective

To perform a detailed EDA on traffic accident data to understand:

- Common causes and types of accidents
- Temporal patterns (days, months, hours)
- Geographic hotspots of accidents
- Influence of weather, lighting, and road conditions
- Vehicle types and casualty distributions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used includes multiple features related to traffic accidents such as:

- Date and time
- Weather conditions
- Road type
- Number of casualties
- Vehicle types involved
- Injury occured and corresponding cause.

## 📈 Key Insights

- 🚦 Accidents are more frequent during peak hours and weekends.
- 🌧️ Weather conditions such as rain or fog significantly increase risk.
- 🛣️ Certain road types (like intersections) have a higher accident density.
- 🚗 Two-wheelers and four-wheelers are most commonly involved.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Apply predictive models to forecast accident probabilities
- Cluster accident-prone zones geographically
- Integrate external datasets (e.g., population density, traffic volume)
